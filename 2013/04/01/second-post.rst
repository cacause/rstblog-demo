reStructuredText - Part II
==========================

Show me some formatting examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can highlight text in *italics* or, to provide even more emphasis
in **bold**. Often, when describing computer code, we like to use a
``fixed space font`` to quote code snippets.

We could include source code files
(by specifying their name) which is useful when documenting code. We
can also copy source code verbatim (i.e. include it in the rst
document) like this::

  int main ( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
      printf("Hello World\n");
      return 0;
  }
