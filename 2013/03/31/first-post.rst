reStructuredText - Part I
=========================

What is reStructuredText?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax
and parser system, abbreviated *rst*. In other words, using a simple
text editor, documents can be created which

- are easy to read in text editor and
- can be *automatically* converted to
 
  - html and 
  - latex (and therefore pdf)

What is it good for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

reStructuredText can be used, for example, to

- write technical documentation (so that it can easily be offered as a
  pdf file or a web page)

- create html webpages without knowing html 

- to document source code
